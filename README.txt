DATA & FILE OVERVIEW

File list: Forms, intro, learnt will be the order that the files need to be read. Whilst adding the images there was an issue and it was not pulling through correctly, due to this I put the images in the same folder as the pages and this resolved the issues.

This was all coded on Visual Studio Code (desktop version 1.95.3).

USE OF FILES
I have crafted this file set to replicate signing up and into my profile for a living professional profile. My idea for this is to have a visual representation of the skills I am and will learn and hopefully when the time comes this will help me look for and potentially get a job in this sector.
As this is for a project this is just the beginning of what I hope is a new career path for myself.

Using the files the idea is that the front page would replicate a log in/registration screen and this is set in a way that would mean the log in button would bypass the need for the details to be filled out.

The main page 'intro.html' is designed in a way that I can update the main body of text to correlate with my professional CV. This also has links to Facebook, LinkedIn, and Instagram - currently these just go to a log in screen.

The learnt screen shows lists and colours, but also tables and the manipulation of the cells.
