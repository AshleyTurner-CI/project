      <p class="p1">I am an experienced motor claims handler and have worked for a number of motor claim firms. I have also worked for a home claims insurer, but I have always preferred the motor side as this is where I started and where most of my knowledge lies. I have worked within the insurance world for almost a decade and I have enjoyed my time in the industry, but now I am looking for a career change. I have been very excited and found myself to be very passionate about coding and development. I look forward to being able to find a career encompassing this.</p>
